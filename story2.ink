=== Introduction

# IMAGE: images/first-morning.jpeg
{CharY} opens her eyes after another short night. It looks like her small room is still the same and a sigh escapes her softly.

They might be tired, but her eyes still find the strength to dance around the room, landing swiftly on her smaller brother, who is still fast asleep.

"I'm sorry you have to go through the same {BroX}, if only I could provide you with a better place, a better situation...", {CharY} thinks to herself. 

Not farther away, close to the opposite wall lies another bed, where a weak cough is being heard. Grandma is sick again.

* [Reflect on past]
    {CharY}'s thoughts start to fly, wondering how all of them got in this situation again, but unfortunately they always stop at the same black door she only rarely dares to open, which is the topic of her parents. 
    
    She got to know them only from Grandma's words, which always come short to "They were kids themselves when they made you. Your dad refused the responsibility and your mother wanted more parties, better men."
    
    The memory always made her stomach turn and she always stopped from pondering on it any longer. With an effort {CharY} cleared her head.

* [Get up]
    
- "Alright, no time to sit in bed."
"Grandma's cough got worse, I would probably have to work more shifts, but I'm not sure I should skip more classes at school. It's my last year and the exams are coming close."

"Should I work the entire day or only the late shift?"

* [Go to school first]
 ->GoToSchool
 
* [Go to work for the full shift]
 ->GoToWork



= GoToSchool
"I will find other days I could take some classes off and get more money, I also need to study or I will lose this year as well."
 
 Without waking her borther or grandma, {CharY} quietly prepared for school and set off for school. 
 
# IMAGE: images/school.jpg
 
 The first class was the usual German, which {CharY} could not stand. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get her knowledge level to a higher level, so she decided German was just not for her and was patiently waiting for the bell to ring.
 
 That's when her friend {FrenX}, whispered to her ear from the back bench:
 "Money again? Why don't you look for a new job already, I'm tired of seeing you sad all the time."
 
 # IMAGE: images/friend.jpg
 
 {CharY}: "You already know there are none better right now, I just have to work more."
 {FrenX}: "Oh yeah? Guess who just started working at a clothing factory for twice your salary."
 {CharY}: "What?! No way! How did you find the offer? Sounds like a scam."
 {FrenX}: "Of course you'd say that! And here I was thinking I could recommend you for the job as well... Oh well, I can't scam my friend, can I?"
 
 "If the pay really is so much better, it might be worth to ask for some more details. I'll manage my time a lot better and asking shouldn't hurt.", {CharY} thought to herself.
 
 * [Ask for Details]
    {CharY}: "Stop being dramatic. Just tell me more already."
    {FrenX}: "Finally! Ok, so don't get any funny ideas, the place isn't the best. You'll spend most of your day standing or running around, but the worst past is that there are some disgu-..."
    
    Teacher: "QUIET ALREADY!"
    {CharY} & {FrenX}: "..."
    Teacher: "Unless you would like to talk about what you were just talking in front of the class, I would advise you to keep quiet!"
    
    {FrenX}: "Excuse us."
    
    As the teacher turned, {FrenX} continued in a lower whisper: "Come tomorrow, I'll tell you more about it."

 The rest of the classes went by like always, and {CharY} was wondering whether the decision to come to school today was really the best.
 
 In any case, she still had to go work, even if it was only at half the value from all the time used at school.

=== Reflection
 {CharY} pushes the creaky door open, her weary eyes scanning the dimly lit room. The soft sound of Grandma's cough echoes through the air, a constant reminder of the responsibilities that weigh heavily on her shoulders. She glances at her brother's bed, relieved to see him still peacefully asleep.
# IMAGE: images/home-late.jpg
The room, bathed in the faint glow of a flickering bulb, feels suffocating. {CharY} sighs, her shoulders slumping as she wearily peels off her work uniform, the stench of sweat clinging to her like a heavy burden. The meager pay for her long hours barely covers the essentials, and today, the frustration of being underappreciated boils within her.
* [Reflect on the day]

{CharY} slumps onto her bed, her tired eyes fixed on the cracked ceiling. The events of the day replay in her mind like a haunting film. The extra hours she put in, the demanding customers, and the manager who seems to conveniently forget the promised overtime pay.

- "I can't believe I've got to go through this. There must be something more."

* [Go online]
   
 As {CharY} mindlessly scrolls through social media to try and relax, an ad catches her eyes.

Morning, once again. The weight of another sleep-deprived night lingers in her tired eyes. She glances around the cramped room, taking in the sight of her brother's innocent sleeping form and Grandma's frail silhouette.

    In the quiet of the morning, a sudden realization strikes {CharY}. "There has to be something better than this," she whispers to herself. The cycle of fatigue and endless responsibilities cannot be the only path for her family.
